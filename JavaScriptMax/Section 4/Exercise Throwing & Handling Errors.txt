Exercise: Throwing & Handling Errors
For this exercise, you must add code to both the breakMe() and the main() functions.

In breakMe(), you should throw a custom error object. This object may contain any data of your choice but it absolutely must contain a message property (which then holds any text of your choice).

main() calls breakMe() but you must adjust the code in main() such that the error thrown by breakMe() is handled and main() therefore does NOT throw an error.

Instead, main() should return (but not throw!) the error object thrown by breakMe().


====================
let b;
function breakMe() {
    const a = 5;
    b = 0;
    if (b == 0){
              // Throwing an object (property: value);
    throw {message: 'This is an ERROR'};
    }
}

function main() {
    // Todo: Handle breakMe()'s error with grace
    try {
    breakMe();
    } catch (error) {
        console.log(error);
        console.log({message: 'This is an ERROR'});
        b=1;
     return error;
    }
}
